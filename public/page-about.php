    <div class="article-start text-block text-block__pad">
      <p>Baijiu—pronounced bye-j’yo, meaning “white spirits” in Mandarin—is a category that encompasses all traditional Chinese grain spirits. Baijiu is most commonly distilled from sorghum, but is also often made from rice, wheat, corn and millet. Production techniques differ significantly by region and style, and different styles of baijiu can be as distinct as whiskey is to tequila.</p>
