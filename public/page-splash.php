    <h1 class="h1">About Ming River</h1>
    <p>The journey to Ming River begins in the heart of Sichuan, China in the lush port city where China’s longest continuously operating distillery makes its legendary liquor. Over the past 700 years, traditional baijiu techniques here have passed from master to apprentice for over 20 generations.</p>

    <p>A balanced and complex spirit, Ming River is the original Sichuan baiju. Each batch starts with locally harvested red sorghum grain and the purest waters from protected wells. It is fermented in earthen pits with naturally harvested yeast cultures native to Luzhou that impart the distinctive terroir of Sichuan style baijiu. After two months, the mash is unearthed and distilled in small batches using a traditional Chinese pot still. The spirits age for up to two years before the master blender balances them into Ming River’s distinctive flavor.</p>

    <p>The result is an uncompromisingly bold spirit with notes of pineapple and anise with a lingering mellow finish. Perfect neat alongside spicy cuisine or in a cocktail, this baijiu evokes Sichuan with each sip.</p>

    <h1 class="h1">Our Story</h1>

    </figure>

    <p>Many people told us baijiu could never succeed internationally. We ignored them. We met in China and fell in love with baijiu. It offered us a world of unexplored flavors and experiences. It changed how we thought about drinks. We had to spread the word.</p>

    <p>Baijiu is a category encompassing all traditional Chinese grain spirits. In terms of flavor and aroma, there’s nothing else like it. The world beyond China knows almost nothing about it, and we have devoted ourselves to correcting that. Derek penned the first English-language book about baijiu. Bill, Matthias and Simon opened the world’s first bar dedicated to baijiu. Now we’re taking our show on the road.</p>

    <p>With Ming River we’re introducing the world to an authentic expression of Sichuan baijiu that reflects over twenty generations of skill and a true taste of the region. We have partnered with China’s oldest continuously operating distillery, Luzhou Laojiao, to bring you the original Sichuan baijiu. Together we’ve taken a tradition that began in the Ming Dynasty and created a shared future.</p>

    <h1 class="h1">How To Enjoy</h1>
    <p>In China they say, “One cannot set the table without alcohol,” which means it’s not a meal without baijiu. Traditionally baijiu is served neat at room temperature to accompany food at mealtimes. It is poured into tiny, thimble-sized shot glasses that are downed in a series of communal toasts. One always drinks with others, so baijiu is associated with raucous, festive drinking sessions.</p>

    <p>China has no indigenous cocktail culture, but the Chinese are fond of infusing baijiu with fruits, spices, herbs and traditional Chinese medicine. These tonics are associated with health and wellness,but are usually not part of the toasting ritual. In recent years, bars in China and elsewhere have begun to experiment with baijiu in cocktails. As an ingredient, its strength and pungency make it challenging but rewarding to work with. It has tremendous untapped potential for adventuresome bartenders.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Drinks and Mixing with Ming River Baijiu:</h3>
        <p>Baijiu is traditionally enjoyed neat at room temperature. Ming River’s fruity sweetness is the perfect counterpoint to the numbing spice of Sichuanese cuisine. As a clear but decidedly non-neutral spirit, in mixed drinks Ming River’s bold aroma and flavor can be called upon to perform like a rhum agricole, Jamaican pot still rum or a Batavia arrack, effortlessly finding a home in tiki drinks while also opening a new world for sours and aperitifs. Additionally, many classic recipes can be enhanced by incorporating Ming River baijiu in a split base or even just as a rinse.</p>
